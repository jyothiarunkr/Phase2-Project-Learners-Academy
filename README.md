# Phase2-Project-Learners-Academy
A college -Learner’s Academy timetable is a temporal arrangement of a set of classes and classrooms in which all given constraints are satisfied. 
Timetabling has long been known to belong to the class of problems called NP hard. This project introduces a practical timetabling algorithm capable 
of taking care of both strong and weak constraints effectively, used in an automated timetabling system.


Our project takes various inputs from the user such as Teacher List, Course List, Semester List, Room List, Day List and Timeslot as well as various rules, 
facts and constraints for generating the Time Table

Project objective: 

As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy. 
Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. 


Background of the problem statement:
Learner’s Academy is a school that has an online management system. The system keeps track of its classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login.
 
Functional Requirements:

 The administrator can:
● Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
● Set up a master list of all the teachers
● Set up a master list of all the classes
● Assign classes for subjects from the master list
● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
     
 
System Design

 The flow and features of the application: 
● Plan more than two sprints to complete the application
● Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart 
● List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application
● Implement the appropriate concepts, such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance 

 Technologies used: 
● Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application 
● Java: A programming language to develop the web pages, databases, and others
● SQL: To create tables for admin, classes, students, and other specifics
● Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 
● GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 
● Scrum: An efficient agile framework to deliver the product incrementally 
● Search and Sort techniques: Data structures used for the project 
● Specification document: Any open-source document or Google Docs
